# Charlottesville-Albemarle-Connectivity-Survey-Analysis
Piedmont Environmental Council and the Thomas Jefferson Planning District Commission 
are working with communities in the Charlottesville and Albemarle urban area to envision 
and implement a comprehensive network of bicycle and pedestrian trails and greenways.
I was working with other UVa students to analyze people's response, to help local NGOs
imporve people's experience on trail/bike lanes.
